# Practise-Exam-Analysis-Tool
This tool allows you to track you performance throughout an exam, taking into account several variables to give you an outputted graph detailing your progress. This tool has been optimised for SACE exams though may work for other systems. I wrote this quickly. There will be bugs.

There are several Steps involved in the process, however any and all measure have been made to avoid confusion and keep things streamlined. 

The Process.

1) Before you sit the exam, you are asked (in step 1) to input the questions and the marks. Input the questions as they appear on the exam and their corresponding marks. Ie Q- 1a is worth 2 marks OR Q- 2aii is worth 7 marks etc. Only when you have finished inputting ALL of your questions and marks press "Finished" at the bottom of the screen. 
NOTE: make sure that the order is correct and that when you do the questions you follow the order.

2) The next step is to input the total exam time. This is necessary because, as a rule of thumb for SACE exams, a 1 mark question should take 1 minute to finish. However since some exams allow extra time, ie 20 mark exam given 30 minutes, there will be a time that can be considered that maximum time for each question, which will be the baseline reccomended time PLUS some additional time.

3) The next step is to sit the exam. When you begin the exam simply click "start". Whenever you finish a question press "quest. done". This will record the time taken for individual questions. The larger timer will show total elapsed time and the smaller timer underneath it will show time elapsed for current question. The time can be paused at any point by simple pressing the middle "pause" button, 1 press will pause the time, another press will unpause the time, as is customary nowadays...

4) The next step when the exam has been completed is to fill out the marks that you have recieved for each question. The questions will appear in the left-most collumn, and the corresponding maximum marks in the next collumn to the right. To input your marks, type your recieved mark for the question in the textbox at the bottom and press "Submit". These, and their corresponding percentages will appear in the final two collumns. When all marks have been entered, a button to "Finalise" will appear at the bottom of the screen. Click It it see the output graph.

5) the output graph shows 3 lines and some number of bars. The three lines corespond to the;
  1) reccomended time per question- based on the marks ie 1 mark= 1 minute
  2) Maximum time per question- based on the marks + additional time from the exam
  3) the actual time taken to complete each question
  
The Bars (if they should appear at the bottm) demonstrate much of the time taken on a particular question was wasted getting it wrong. ie if you got 2/3 marks for a queston and it took 3 seconds, 1/3 of the time was wasted getting the wrong mark and hence the bar will go to 1 second.

If you wish to save this result, screen shot it. A save option was attempted, however since the IT staff decided it  would be a cool idea to fuck around with the admin privellages, it is too hard to tell whether the code was bad or whether there were insufficient permissions to save a goddamn JPEG.

SORRY.

THERE WILL BE BUGS. THIS WAS RUSHED. I MIGHT FIX THEM IF YOU LET ME KNOW. OR I MIGHT NOT.

THANKS.
